# Aurora Corne's Custom Keymap

Keymaps in general are quite personal, so it is difficult to come up with a default that will suit every user. We hope this keymap serves as a good starting point for your own - although it should be fairly usable out-of-the-box.

What do all these layers do?
----------------------------

### Layer 0: Base layer

This is where your basic letters live.

The homing thumb fingers are used to access the different layers.

* The homing left thumb finger gives access to the Numbers (or lower) layer
* The homing right thumb finger gives access to the Symbols (or raise) layer
* Pressing both homing thumb fingers gives access to the Adjust layer

### Layer 1: Lower

The Lower layer gives access to your number keys on the top row. It also exposes the arrow keys in the usual Vim-style layout.

### Layer 2: Raise

The Raise layer gives access to the symbols. In addition to shifted number keys on the top row, the right hand also exposes the remaining symbol keys, both as shifted and non-shifted variants.

### Layer 3: Adjust
